### Hi there 👋	:robot:
#### Carlos Engels || Backend Developer
![Backend Developer](https://github.com/carlosengels/carlosengels/blob/main/background_landscape.png)

I'm a Backend Developer with experience in software development, AWS implementation, deployment and configuration.

I've worked in a helpdesk environment which serviced clients globally and I was able to perfect solving problems, one ticket at a time. With my problem-solving mindset and software development skills I identify and address complex business challenges such as scaling support for applications. Now I've embarked on the software development journey with the goal to help organizations scale their operations reliably. 

As the world has become more technologically interconnected and vulnerable I want to bring my passion for threat mitigation to my future employer. By leveraging the experience that I gained through the CompTIA Security+ certification and my personal CLI port scanner project I will bring security awareness to my next development role.
